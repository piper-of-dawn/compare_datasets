## Test 1: Comparison of the String Columns
Jaccard Similarity is defined as the ratio of the cardinality of the intersection of the two sets (expected and tested) divided by the cardinality of the union of the sets. 

J(A,B) = n(A ∩ B) / n(A ∪ B).

The Jaccard Similarity is a number between 0 and 1. 0 means the two sets are completely different, 1 means the two sets are identical. Jaccard Similarity is an order insensitive measure of set similarity. Jaccard Similarity of 1 does not imply the order of values in the two columns are identical.
